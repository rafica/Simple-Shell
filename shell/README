**************
List of functions:
 * main
 * get_input
 * process_string
 * find_path
 * process_pipe
 * execute_pipe
 * trim_white_space
 * concat
 * general_concat

 In "main", Initially the file descriptors of stdin and stdout are saved.
 "get_input" is called which gets the input character by character till \n is pressed
The input string is then trimmed of leading and trailing white space
The string is checked if it has pipe. If it has, "process_pipe" is called
If it doesnt have pipe, tokenize the string into an array and pass it to "process_string"
Depending on the return value of process_string the shell continues or exits.

Error handling:
Handled all system calls.
